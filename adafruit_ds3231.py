`adafruit_ds3231` - DS3231 Real Time Clock module
=================================================
CircuitPython library to support DS3231 Real Time Clock (RTC).

This library supports the use of the DS3231-based RTC in CircuitPython.

Author(s): Philip R. Moyer and Radomir Dopieralski for Adafruit Industries.

Implementation Notes
--------------------

**Hardware:**

* Adafruit `DS3231 Precision RTC FeatherWing <https://www.adafruit.com/products/3028>`_  (Product ID: 3028)
* Adafruit `DS3231 RTC breakout <https://www.adafruit.com/products/3013>`_ (Product ID: 3013)
* Adafruit `ChronoDot - Ultra-precise Real Time Clock - v2.1 <https://www.adafruit.com/products/255>`_ (Product ID: 3013)

**Software and Dependencies:**

* Adafruit CircuitPython firmware for the ESP8622 and M0-based boards: https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/releases
* Adafruit's Register library: https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Register
* Adafruit's Bus Device library: https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_BusDevice

**Notes:**

#. Milliseconds are not supported by this RTC.
#. Datasheet: https://datasheets.maximintegrated.com/en/ds/DS3231.pdf
